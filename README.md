# Reptiletracker 
UI for the Reptiletracker project. 
[Reptiletracker](https://github.com/atenghamn/ReptileTracker)

In a first iteration this UI will be very simple. Since I'm not sure about how I will use the reptiletracker the UI I dont have a very clear idea on how to desgin the UI (if you got any ideas, bring em :D ) 

A couple of features are planned for the first iteration
 - Login / Logout 
 - Create account 
 - CRUD for reptiles
 - Keeping a simple log of your reptiles eating and shedding
 - Keeping a simple log of your reptiles weight and length

 That's pretty much the roadmap for now, more will come :D
